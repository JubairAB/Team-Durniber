From 1957 to 2022, the space satellite field rapidly expanded with massive infrastructure and huge investments, and a significant number of researchers, scientists, and enthusiasts with their collaborative working knowledge propelled this field to unprecedented levels. Its technology connects the entire globe, from North Pole to South Pole, having formed a 360-degree global network dome that turns the world into a global village. Despite the fact that it has numerous advantages, due to its high cost and complicated system, it is unreachable.



Project Hello World is a prototype of a small satellite data relay communication network system orbiting in LEO (low earth orbit) that communicates with a portable ground communicating unit based on a mobile app.

Its principal function is to transfer data from one location to another.
The data can be anything, from an open analog signal to an encrypted digital signal, which can be sent anywhere in the world.
With its uhf uplink and downlink, the satellite is simple to use and accessible to everyone.The network, along with its open-source portable GCU (ground communicating unit), can be accessed via a mobile app.
 

 
The user logs in to the GCU using its interactive and simple app.
 
 
 
The application provides the features and functionalities after connecting to the GCU.
 
When a user selects a program from the app, the data is collected and sent to the GCU. The GCU collects the information and stores it in its storage unit. The GCU then goes into sleep mode and awaits the next satellite coverage. As the satellite gets closer, it starts transmitting data on the dedicated uplink frequency. At the same time, it collects all of the data transmitted by the satellite via the downlink. If the user is authorized, he can retrieve the data from the database.
 


When the satellite is in orbit around the world, it does the same thing indefinitely. In a single day, a single cube satellite cannot cover the entire globe. To achieve global coverage, 50-80 satellites are required. Satellites can be easily built and deployed because they are inexpensive.
